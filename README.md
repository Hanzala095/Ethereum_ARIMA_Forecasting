# Ethereum Price Forecasting using ARIMA 📈

This project applies ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling to predict Ethereum (ETH/USD) prices. It was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Arch Technologies.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels

## 📊 Key Features
- Cleaned and prepared historical ETH/USD dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked stationarity using ADF test
- Applied ARIMA(1,1,1) model
- Forecasted prices for 30 future days
- Visualized real vs predicted prices

## 📄 Files Included
- `arima_model.ipynb` — Full working notebook with markdowns and code
- `Ethereum_Forecast_Report.pdf` — Formal internship report with graphs and analysis
